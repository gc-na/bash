# [Linux] Bash ulimit uso equivalente: Manage user process limits

## Overview
The `ulimit` command in Bash is used to set or display user-level resource limits for the shell and its child processes. This command helps manage system resources by controlling the maximum amount of resources that can be consumed by processes.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `ulimit` command is as follows:

```bash
ulimit [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-a`: Display all current limits.
- `-c`: Set the maximum size of core files created.
- `-d`: Set the maximum size of a process's data segment.
- `-f`: Set the maximum size of files created by the shell.
- `-l`: Set the maximum size allowed for locked-in-memory segments.
- `-m`: Set the maximum resident set size.
- `-n`: Set the maximum number of open file descriptors.
- `-s`: Set the maximum stack size.
- `-t`: Set the maximum amount of CPU time (in seconds) that the process can use.
- `-v`: Set the maximum virtual memory available to the process.

## Common Examples

### Display All Limits
To view all current limits for the user, use:
```bash
ulimit -a
```

### Set Maximum Number of Open Files
To set the maximum number of open files to 1024:
```bash
ulimit -n 1024
```

### Set Maximum Stack Size
To set the maximum stack size to 8 MB:
```bash
ulimit -s 8192
```

### Set Maximum CPU Time
To limit the CPU time to 60 seconds:
```bash
ulimit -t 60
```

### Set Core File Size
To prevent core dumps by setting the core file size to 0:
```bash
ulimit -c 0
```

## Tips
- Always check current limits with `ulimit -a` before making changes to avoid unintended consequences.
- Use `ulimit` in scripts to ensure that processes spawned by the script adhere to the specified limits.
- Be cautious when increasing limits, as it may lead to resource exhaustion on the system.

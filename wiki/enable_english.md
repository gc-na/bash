# [Linux] Bash enable: Enable or disable shell builtins

## Overview
The `enable` command in Bash is used to enable or disable shell builtins. Builtins are commands that are built into the shell itself, allowing for faster execution and reduced resource usage compared to external commands. This command is particularly useful for managing the availability of builtins in your shell environment.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `enable` command is as follows:

```bash
enable [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-n` : Disable the specified builtin.
- `-a` : Enable all builtins.
- `-p` : Display the current status of builtins.

## Common Examples

### Enable a Specific Builtin
To enable a specific builtin, such as `echo`, you can use:

```bash
enable echo
```

### Disable a Specific Builtin
To disable a builtin, for example, `echo`, use:

```bash
enable -n echo
```

### List All Builtins
To see the current status of all builtins, you can run:

```bash
enable -p
```

### Enable All Builtins
To enable all builtins at once, use:

```bash
enable -a
```

## Tips
- Use `enable -p` regularly to check which builtins are currently enabled or disabled in your shell environment.
- Disabling builtins can lead to unexpected behavior in scripts, so use this command with caution.
- Remember that changes made with `enable` are session-specific; they will not persist after you close the terminal.

# [Linux] Bash ufw Uso: Manage firewall rules easily

## Overview
The `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) command is a user-friendly interface for managing firewall rules in Linux systems. It simplifies the process of configuring the firewall, making it easier for users to allow or deny network traffic.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `ufw` command is as follows:

```bash
ufw [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `enable`: Activates the firewall.
- `disable`: Deactivates the firewall.
- `status`: Displays the current status of the firewall and its rules.
- `allow [port]`: Allows incoming traffic on the specified port.
- `deny [port]`: Denies incoming traffic on the specified port.
- `delete [rule]`: Removes a specified rule from the firewall.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `ufw` command:

1. **Enable the firewall:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

2. **Check the status of the firewall:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

3. **Allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP):**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 80
   ```

4. **Deny incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH):**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw deny 22
   ```

5. **Delete a rule allowing traffic on port 80:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw delete allow 80
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the status of your firewall after making changes to ensure the rules are set as intended.
- Use `ufw status verbose` for a detailed view of the rules and their statuses.
- Consider backing up your current rules before making significant changes, using `sudo ufw status > ufw-backup.txt`.

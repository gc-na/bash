# [Linux] Bash logout Usage: Exit the current shell session

## Overview
The `logout` command is used in Bash to terminate a login shell session. When executed, it logs the user out of the current shell, effectively closing the terminal or console session. This command is particularly useful when you want to safely exit from a remote session or a terminal window.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `logout` command is as follows:

```bash
logout [options]
```

## Common Options
The `logout` command does not have many options, but here are a couple of common ones:

- `--help`: Displays help information about the command.
- `--version`: Shows the version of the shell being used.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Basic Logout
To log out of the current shell session, simply type:

```bash
logout
```

### Example 2: Logout from a Remote Session
If you are connected to a remote server via SSH, you can log out by entering:

```bash
logout
```

### Example 3: Using Logout in a Script
In a script, you can use `logout` to end a session after completing tasks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Perform some tasks
echo "Tasks completed. Logging out..."
logout
```

## Tips
- Always ensure that you have saved your work before executing `logout`, as it will close your session immediately.
- If you are using a non-login shell, `logout` may not work as expected; consider using `exit` instead.
- For remote sessions, remember that logging out will terminate your connection, so make sure you are ready to disconnect.
